# Stock Price Volatility Forecasting with GARCH Models in R

This project focuses on forecasting stock price volatility using various GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) models in R. By leveraging time series analysis techniques and volatility forecasting tools, we aim to provide accurate and insightful predictions of stock market volatility.

## Project Overview
- Data collection and preprocessing: Obtain historical stock price data for the target stocks, clean the data, and ensure consistency.
- Exploratory data analysis: Visualize the stock price trends, identify patterns, and analyze statistical characteristics.
- GARCH model selection: Experiment with different GARCH variants such as GARCH(1,1), GARCH-M, EGARCH, etc., to determine the best-fitting model.
- Model estimation and evaluation: Estimate the chosen GARCH models, evaluate their performance, and compare their forecasting accuracy.
- Volatility forecasting: Generate future volatility forecasts using the selected GARCH model, providing insights for risk management and trading strategies.
- Visualization and interpretation: Present the results using informative plots and graphs to aid in understanding the volatility dynamics of the target stocks.
